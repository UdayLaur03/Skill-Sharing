# Skill-Sharing
Agile project _
This project is a web-based chat application that allows users to sign up and engage in real-time conversations. Built using Node.js for the backend and MongoDB for the database, it features a simple and intuitive interface for users to register and interact with others. The application allows users to securely sign up with a username and password, and stores this information in the database. Once signed up, users can send and receive chat messages, with the messages being stored persistently in MongoDB. The project is fully dockerized, ensuring easy deployment across environments, and employs robust testing practices including unit testing, integration testing, and security measures. Whether you're looking to build a real-time chat platform or just explore full-stack development, this project provides a solid foundation with a focus on performance, security, and scalability.
